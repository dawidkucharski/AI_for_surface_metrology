R code -  Machine Learning and AI for Surface Metrology Application

The project aims to experimentally analyse the possibility of implementing artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) in an assisted selection of measurement parameters using contact and non-contact devices for surface irregularities measurements. The implementation will be concerned with the complex impact of the type and degree of data filtering on the measured metrological parameters when using various measurement techniques. Depending on the measuring object and the parameters of surface irregularities, measurement technique, resolution, measurement uncertainty, and other initial information required for its assessment, the algorithm developed within the specified range will relieve the operator before measuring by selecting the measurement technique from the database of available metrological devices, measurement speed, sampling density, type and degree of data filtering used.
